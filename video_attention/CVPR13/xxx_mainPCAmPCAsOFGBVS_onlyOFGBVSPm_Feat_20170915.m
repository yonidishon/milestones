% Experiment goal:
%   Prove that my saliency maps contribute to classification accuracy
%   How: 
%       1. Use both mine and OF+GBVS candidates but do not use my features in
%       The feature vector.
%       2. Use both mine and OF+GBVS candidates but do not use S-PCA in my features in
%       The feature vector.
%       3. Compare the results of (1) and (2) to the original
%       PCAmPCAsOFGBVS performance.
% (2) step:
